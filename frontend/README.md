Frontend prototype (single-file React component).  
This is a UI prototype meant to be integrated into a React + Tailwind project.

To run locally (quick):
1. Create a React app (Vite / CRA) and add Tailwind.
2. Copy `src/AbyssApp.jsx` into your project.
3. Start dev server.

**Dependencies** recommended:
- react 18+
- tailwindcss
- optional: bip39, bitcoinjs-lib (for production key derivation)
